      <h4>Hello welcome to Bite Share, the wonderful website designed to help lower wasted food in the Davis area. This site is designed
      to combat the large number of food disposed of each day despite being perfectly edible. Hunger is a problem faced by several 
      counties in California, but this website would like to combat it in Davis specifically.
      
       After registering an account, you have the option of either posting extra food you have, searching for food if you would like some
      but are unable to, or just want to see what people are leaving behind. This site is not designed just for individuals, as food banks 
      and the like are also hosted and noted for those who would like that. 
      
      After selecting what food you would like to pick up, a map will pop up showing you where to go to receive thefood, alongside a text to 
      both the person picking it up and the person offering, allowing for both parties to be informed of the coming interaction.

      We hope that this mitigates at least some of the food surplus and hunger across Davis and that social welfare is improved.
      Thanks for reading!

      <h15>(Disclaimer: users posting food will be required to list their address as to note where to pick up food from. If this is an issue, please
      register your account using address you can drop the food off at, but wpuld feel comfortable meeting others at. Only registered users are able
      to see these addresses, so security is fairly well-kept)</h15>
